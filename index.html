					<p>Hey there! I'm Antoine, a passionate 22-year-old aspiring computer engineer. 
						I've been on an exciting journey of learning and gaining practical experience through apprenticeships for the past four years. 
						It's been amazing to apply what I've learned in the classroom to real-world projects. 
					Technology and problem-solving have always fascinated me, and I love diving into complex challenges and finding innovative solutions. </p>
					<p>Working with experienced professionals and collaborating with diverse teams has sharpened my technical skills and taught me the importance of communication and teamwork. 
					I'm thrilled about the endless possibilities in the field of computer engineering and I'm looking forward to keep contributing with my creativity, dedication, and expertise to this field.</p>

									<p>I worked at Xenocs from 2019 to 2021 for my BTS SNIR and from 2021 to 2022 for my Bachelor Devops. I consider myself very lucky to have been able to start my professional career in such a company. The colleagues were really nice, and the atmosphere was very relaxed but professional.</p>
									<p>During my BTS I was in charge of computer stock and I also took care of user support on site. I was also the link between the external service providers and the company at the IT level. I also had the chance to have a very stimulating end-of-BTS project.</p>
									<p>For my year of Bachelor Devops, I had the opportunity to work on an internal website, which listed all the machines sold by the company. I also worked on adding new machines directly through the site. Even if I was not able to validate my Bachelor year, it was an extremely rewarding year.</p>

									<p>I am currently at Nomios for my apprenticeship as a computer engineer. I started at Nomios in October 2022 and it's really a very nice company. Even if the missions carried out by Nomios are very different from my past experiences, it is in fact a wish on my part.</p>
									<p>Indeed, after having done a lot of programming, I wanted to orient myself a little more on the network and cyber-security part of the informatic spectrum and I am very happy to have made this choice.</p>
									<p> Thanks to Nomios, I discovered another area of IT completely different from what I already knew. But that does not mean that my previous experiences are useless. I am very useful to the company for everything that involves automating procedures, generating reports... It's very pleasant to feel useful for your skills.</p> 
									<p>Another point that changes from my previous experiences is customer contact and travel. It's something essential to the job and one that I particularly appreciate.</p>

							<p>The Easy Save project is a project I did at school in a team of 4. It's a desktop application that manages backups. It is an application coded in C# and we used Azure Devops as a Git server to manage the versions of the project.</p>
							<p>It's a project I'm particularly proud of, because I had never done desktop application development and we did very well.</p>
							<p>This application could manage several dozen backups, run them at the same time, pause them, etc... There was even a feature to monitor and interact with the application with another computer on the network.</p>

							<p>This is my very first corporate project where I was the main actor.</p>
							<p>Xenocs commissioned me to build a chip programming station. These chips were then integrated into the samples which were going to be analyzed by the XEUSS (one of the machines manufactured by Xenocs and used for characterization). Depending on what was written in the chip (the size of the sample, its viscosity, etc.), the machine adopted a certain behavior.</p> 
							<p>So I made the station with the help of some colleagues that I asked, and I created a graphical interface to write more easily on the chips. The logic was in Python and the GUI was made with QT
							</p> 
							<p>It was an extremely rewarding project, knowing that even after my BTS passed, the chip programming station was still in use a year later and I continued to improve it.</p>

							<p>Another project I did in engineering school. The goal of this project was to manipulate huge amounts of data and to imagine an architecture capable of processing them in order to be able to exploit them.
							During this project, I discovered a whole part of computer science on which I had only prejudices.</p>
							<p>We had as starting material, a Postgres database, Excel files of several dozen GB.
							With the use of several tools including Talend or Apache Hive, our group succeeded in processing the information in order to be able to draw graphics that could help decision-making.</p> 
							<p>Even if the material that the school provided us with was not enough to carry out the project, it was very interesting to do.</p>

								<p>At the request of my father, who is a craftsman butcher, I built a website so that he would have more visibility on the internet.</p>
								<p>I started this project at the beginning of my higher education in 2019. Initially, I coded the whole site by hand in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  At the end of my Bachelor Devops in 2022, I updated the site with the new technologies that I had used in class and in business. I used Angular that I learned in business, I reduced the size of the photos, I did what was necessary for the site to be better referenced by Google, etc...</p>

								<p>This is the second big project I did at Xenocs where I was the main actor.</p> 
								<p>This project consisted of creating an internal Web platform for the company. The purpose of this platform is to display all the machines sold by Xenocs, and to have a place that synchronizes all the information concerning the machines. The site also included a "machine builder" where one could create a very specific machine and add it to the database. The front of the application was in Angular, the back was in NestJS and we used MySQL as the database.</p>

								<p>This is the first project I did in my training as a computer engineer. This project was quite easy from my point of view because with my BTS SNIR I already had most of the knowledge needed to do this project.</p> 
								<p>The goal was to upgrade a network infrastructure in order to integrate it into a larger infrastructure. During this project we were able to study Microsoft's Active Directory, group policies, containerization for applications, etc...</p> 
								<p>This is perhaps my favorite project that we did in school, because at the beginning, we had to make an inventory of the network without having any indication. This part interested me a lot and I was very motivated to do it.</p>
